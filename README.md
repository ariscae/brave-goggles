Brave is an open source web browser based on Chromium. Brave is the only mainstream browser offering true user privacy protection via Firewall, VPN, ad and tracker Shields, and Tor integration. Brave is also the first browser to offer users compensation for ads viewership, in the form of BAT (Basic Attention Tokens). And it's free. Thanks, Brave!
